# Accelerated-Loan-Risk-Assesement
Using a spark notebook to accelerate loan default model creation.

### Background:
Attemping to predict loan defaults is one of the many use cases for machine learning in the finacial services industry.
Datasets generated by banks are massive and lead to long model training times and can lead to slower decisions which isn't great when you're trying to apply for a loan.

### Data Source:
[Lending Club Kaggle Chanllege](https://www.kaggle.com/wendykan/lending-club-loan-data)
<br>
Lending Club is a website that 


### Solution:
I've created a simple spark scala script to handle the most computationally inenstive parts of training the loan default classification model that can be applied to a dataset that I preprocessed from Lending Club in Jupyter Notebook.
